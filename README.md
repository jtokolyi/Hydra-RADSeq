# Hydra-RADSeq

This repository contains scripts used to analyze Hydra oligactis RAD-Seq data described in: Miklós M., Laczkó L., Sramkó, G., Sebestyén, F., Barta, Z., and Tökölyi, J: Phenotypic plasticity rather than genetic differentiation underlies reproductive choices in hydra populations.

Script files are numbered in the sequence they were evaluated. Note that bash scripts were run on a supercomputing grid running the SLULRM task manager.
